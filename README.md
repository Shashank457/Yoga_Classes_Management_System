# Yoga_Classes_Management_System

# Working:
This project has a very interactive website that helps users to register for paid Yoga Classes in terms of monthly subscriptions in their chosen slots. 
The option will be provided to the user to choose the new slot after one month and pay for the next month.

 
# Implementation:
The frontend was made using HandleBars, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and interactive UI.<br>
The backend was developed in node.js and express.js. Using some middlewares like jwt, to generate tokens, and cors to enable the external ports for the frontend.<br>
I have used MongoDB Atlas as Database for storing different types of data like user details, payment details, and slot booking details.
